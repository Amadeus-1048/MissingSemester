This is a sentence. 
In Insert mode, x will just insert a character 'x'.
For example, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.

But in Normal mode, x will delete the character under the cursor.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

In Visual mode, it will delete the selection.

That is to say, 
x: Normal mode 下是删除一个字符，Visual mode 下是删除整个选中区域
